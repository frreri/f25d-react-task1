## About this project

This project was created as a turn in for an assignment in a react course.
I've used both useState and useEffect to create a simple navbar + sidebar layout.
In mobile mode you open the nav menu with a burger menu button, and the side bar expands from the side with a toggle

I've organized the components in a way that separates bigger parts, so the navbar related components are under the directories components -> navbar, and the sidebar related components are under components -> sidebar
